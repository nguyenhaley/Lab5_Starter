### Question 1
Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "message" feature. This is because the "message" feature is a small part of the entire application that can be tested and altered without affecting other parts of the application. Using unit tests to ensure that this feature runs smoothly could prevent any possible obstacles dealing with sending messages in the future.

### Question 2
Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature. Since this feature only deals with a part of the entire application, unit tests would be useful in debugging it and also helpful in ensuring that no other features will be affected when altering it.
